## 📊 **WHAT TO EXPECT TONIGHT**

With **80% threshold**, you should typically see:

**Example output from master_workflow.py:**
```
Total games: 6
  YES decisions: 3-4     ← 80%+ confidence
  MAYBE decisions: 1-2   ← 70-79% confidence
  NO decisions: 1-2      ← Below 70%
```

**Then threshold comparison shows:**
```
At 80%: 3 picks
At 75%: 5 picks (2 additional at 76-78%)
```

**Then parlay optimizer recommends:**
```
Best 3-leg: Games 1+2+3 (EV: +0.234)
